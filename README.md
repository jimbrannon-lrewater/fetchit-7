fetchit-7
=========

fetchit-7 is a Drupal 7 module and related code that creates unique Drupal 6 CCK content enabling the easy creation of controls and forms for display and interaction with an external PostgreSQL database on the back-end and to Google Data Visualization objects on the front-end.  This is the repo for the work (LOTS of it) to convert the LRE internal Drupal 6 module code into an official release for Drupal 7.
